# Augmented Reality Card Game

A Unity based project that uses augmented reality to similuate a card game similar to that featured in the popular TV show, Yu-Gi-Oh. I have retrieved the files from the Cardiff University Project Allocation & Tracking System, as it's a featured project from the class of 2020 where this was our final project. I have also attached the supporting report and UML diagram for nostalgia purposes; It provides a nice indication of how much I have developed since then. The overall project idea has some good traction since 2020 where online you can find similar ideas following the Yu-Gi-Oh card game closer, trying to bring one my childhood favourites into reality.

The code is extremely outdated and doesn't reflect my overall abilities, due to me working as a Software Engineer since. However, I have retrieved the files from the system, as it seems like a fun weekend project to update it and get it working. Based on some initial research, Unity now has support for augmented reality, due to their AR foundation. When this project was developed this did not exist, hence it uses the Vuforia Engine.

## Future Plans

The initial plan would be to depricate the usage of Vuforia, as well as getting the overall project working as a Unity project. Currently, it only features the assets folder and the mentioned supporting materials. I would then clean up the code to make the project more understandable following good Software Engineering principles. After that when I have time I would want to use my AI knowledge to flesh out the game to better degree. It could potentially be a cool reinforcement learning project with some form of AI engine that allow NPC to evolve.
